Customer's prompt on Upwork:
"i need to get the price per day from this url using requests and python"

I created a pandas dataframe with "day of the month" and "price" columns. 
The price column is the price of plane ticket for that given day. 

Libraries used: 
bs4
requests
selenium 
pandas

I ran this python script in terminal with the following command:
python skycanner.py
